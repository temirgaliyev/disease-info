# Disease Info
Simple and lightweight web-application that gives you some statistics about diseases

### Project Goal
For obvious reasons, many sick people limit communication, less often appear in crowded places. This might create a false impression of disease statistics. Our mini-project should help to show the real statistics of some diseases and let people to think about their health and lifestyle. 

### Tech
- **Backend** (will be) written on *python3* using *flask* framework
- **Frontend** not decided yet
- **Database** - *PostgreSQL* because it's free, opensource and has active community. Developers of PostgreSQL speaks at conferences and share the details of the implementation of the base

Note: Tech specification (and the application type) might be changed in near future. We have some issues in the team.
